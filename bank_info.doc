The Banknote Dataset involves predicting whether a given banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced.
There are 1,372 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

1. Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
2. Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
3. Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
4. Entropy of image (continuous).
5. Class (0 for authentic, 1 for inauthentic).
The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 50%.
